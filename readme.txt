To Get to Vashon Island in Puget Sound, Washington

You follow the road 
down to the cabin 
built from the ground 
up in the sixties 
by four women bio-
engineers in love 
—goes the true story 
hidden from me
until recently—to this 

cabin, beside which my great uncle, 
in the seventies, built a lodge 
with the logs that loosened 
from timber boats in the Sound 
and washed up on shore 
for him to rebuild himself with. 

And above that sweet cabin which, 
my uncle bought in the eighties, 
swayed a giant cedar whose branches
caught my kid laughter in the nineties, 
when I was scared by my great uncle’s ghost 
stories, sitting on this half circle of a log 
around a big fire, watching the sun 
slip below the horizon, second by
second: my first understanding 
that the world really is turning 
and that I am turning with it 
feeling like a personal secret. 

I came back to write, found an otter family 
living under the deck, and burned 
my first drafts in the stove. 

This morning, I walked down to the shoreline 
and saw the otter mother’s 
fly-humming skeleton, 

and came back inside to keep this stove fire 
going with chopped-up blocks 
of that old swaying cedar.
