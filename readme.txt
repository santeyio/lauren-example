To Get to Vashon Island in Puget Sound

You follow the road
down to the shore
to a small cabin
built by four women bioengineers in love
  in the sixties—the true story kept from me
              until recently—to this cabin, beside which my
           great uncle, in the seventies, built a lodge with the logs
       that loosened from timber boats in the Sound
   and washed up on shore for him to rebuild himself
    with—and above that cabin, which, my great uncle bought in the eighties,
                   swayed a giant cedar whose branches
                  caught my kid laughter in the nineties,
                 when I was scared by that great uncle’s ghost
                 stories, sitting on this half circle of a log
                    around a big fire, watching the sun
                     slip below the Sound, second by
                      second: my first understanding
                       that the world really is turning
                        and that I am turning with it,
                         feeling like a personal secret—
You follow that road, as I have now done, winding
 down to the cabin, to the half circle log,
  to write scraps and eat beans.
      I found an otter family living under the cabin deck,
       brought in by high tide. I burned my first drafts
        in the stove.
             This morning, I walked down to the shoreline and saw
              the otter mother’s fly-humming skeleton
               near some seaweed.
                    Then I came back inside to keep my stove fire going
                     using chopped-up blocks of that old
                      swaying
                       cedar.
